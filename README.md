## CHAPTER 3: DESIGN OF DATA PIPELINE

### **Pipeline Components**
1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Extracted data from CSV files in **Amazon S3** using **AWS Glue crawlers** for schema discovery.
2. **Real-time Streaming:**  
   - Used **Apache Kafka** for streaming data in real-time.  
   - Kafka topics represent streams like artists, tracks, and albums.
3. **Staging Layer:**  
   - **AWS EC2** instances used for transformation and staging with Python scripts.  
   - EC2 instances ensure fault tolerance and scalability.
4. **Data Transformation:**  
   - **AWS Glue ETL jobs** performed data cleansing, normalization, and aggregation.
5. **Data Warehousing:**  
   - Transformed data stored in **Amazon S3** for efficient storage and retrieval.  
   - **AWS Glue Crawler** managed metadata.
6. **Querying:**  
   - **Amazon Athena** enabled interactive querying directly on S3 data using SQL.
7. **Visualization:**  
   - Insights visualized with **Amazon QuickSight** dashboards.
